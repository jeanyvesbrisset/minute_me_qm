# minute_me_qm
projet minute_me

This is a app I developped during my internship at Quantmetry. The application was made with React Native (Javascript). It is the starting point of a bigger project that was made at Quantmetry.
I did not have previous knowledge of React-Native nor Javascript at the beggining of the project, but managed to learn and upskill in a short amount of time.


Features:

- Recording of audio (meeting, interviews... for example)
- Written transcription of those audio files

The back-end infrastructure was made on AWS, serverless.
